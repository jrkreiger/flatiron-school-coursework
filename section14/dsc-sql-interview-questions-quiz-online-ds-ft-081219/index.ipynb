    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main SQLite3 datatypes are:\n",
    "- text\n",
    "- integer\n",
    "- real (i.e., decimal/float/double, up to 15 characters)\n",
    "- blob (used for binary data)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use other common types from other dialects of SQL; if possible, they will be coerced to SQLite3 datatypes (e.g., INT will be coerced to INTEGER)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary key is a column containing a unique value for each row in a table. There can be more than one primary key used in combination to uniquely identify each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is the primary key of another table, which will not necessarily be a unique value in the table one is currently referencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-one: a unique value in Table 1 matches a unique value in Table 2.\n",
    "One-to-many: a unique value in Table 1 matches several values in Table 2.\n",
    "Many-to-many: a recurring value in Table 1 matches several values in Table 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner join: selects rows where two tables have matching values in a certain column\n",
    "Left join: selects all rows from Table 1 and any rows from Table 2 with matching values in a certain column\n",
    "Right join: selects all rows from Table 2 and any rows from Table 1 with matching values in a certain column\n",
    "Outer join: selects rows where two tables _do not_ have matching values in a certain column (not supported in SQLite3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions are used in conjunction with GROUP BY statements to perform some calculation on data that has been grouped according to values in a certain column. Once data has been grouped by values in a certain column, an aggregate function can then be applied to calculate the mean, median, sum, count, etc., of values per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "In a many-to-many join, associative entities contain all possible combinations of selected values from Table 1 and Table 2. Each row in the JOIN table represents a unique combination of a value from Table 1 and a value from Table 2. The JOIN table is a third location outside of Tables 1 & 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "

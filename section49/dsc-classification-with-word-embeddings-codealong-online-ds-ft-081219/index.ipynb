To download this file, follow the link above and select the file called `glove.6b.zip`.  For simplicity's sake, you can also start the download by clicking [this link](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip).  You'll be using the GloVe file containing 100-dimensional word vectors for 6 billion words.
